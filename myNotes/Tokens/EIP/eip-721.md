# ERC-721: Non-Fungible Token Standard

### Transfer Mechanism

ERC-721 standardizes a safe transfer function `safeTransferFrom` (overloaded with and without a `bytes` parameter) and an unsafe function `transferFrom`. Transfers may be initiated by:

    The owner of an NFT
    The approved address of an NFT
    An authorized operator of the current owner of an NFT

Additionally, an authorized operator may set the approved address for an NFT. This provides a powerful set of tools for wallet, broker and auction applications to quickly use a large number of NFTs.
